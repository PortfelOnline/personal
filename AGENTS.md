# AGENTS.md — Codex Guide for `personal`

## Purpose
- Project: personal notes and reference documentation.
- Goal for agents: keep notes clear, atomic, and easy to navigate.

## Repository Map
- `notes/` — topic-based markdown files.

## Working Rules
- Do not edit `CLAUDE.md` in this repository.
- Prefer updating existing note files over creating near-duplicate notes.
- Keep one main topic per file.
- Use concise headings and short sections.

## Verify Before Claiming Done
- Ensure markdown is readable and links/paths are valid.
- Check that filenames and section titles reflect the note content.
