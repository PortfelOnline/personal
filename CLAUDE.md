- Always `git pull` before starting work on a project

- Ask before pushing to main if there are open PRs or CI

Short version:
- Less instructions = better instruction-following
- Use Progressive Disclosure — read project docs only when needed
- Claude is not a linter — use dedicated tools for formatting
